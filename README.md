==========================================

In this repository you can find the R script and the documentation corresponding to the project of the course "getting and Cleaning Data".
The script processes the data available in [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). These data were  collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

In the repository you can find the following files:

 * run_analysis.R : It cotains the R code used to process the data in order to get a tidy data set with the mean of some of the magnitudes by activity and subject. ###If you want to use the script you need to change the working directory.
